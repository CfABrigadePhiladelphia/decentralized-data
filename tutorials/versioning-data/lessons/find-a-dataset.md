## Goals (Learning Objectives)

After doing this tutorial you will know how to

* Find open source datasets on Github

## Activities

### Step: Find a Dataset on Github
Find a dataset on github that contains CSV files. There's a very big list of datasets here: [https://github.com/datasets/](https://github.com/datasets/)

Careful - not all datasets are CSV. You want CSV files for this exercise.

### Step: Fork the dataset

Fork the dataset into your github account.

### Step: Clone the Dataset to your Local Machine
Clone the git repository in the same way that you would clone any git repository

1. Get the git clone url for your fork of the dataset (ie. `git@github.com:yourgithubname/datasetname`)
2. Clone the Dataset to your Local Machine using the git clone url
`git clone git@github.com:yourgithubname/datasetname`

## Next Steps

Next, [Import the dataset into Noms](../import-the-dataset-into-noms)

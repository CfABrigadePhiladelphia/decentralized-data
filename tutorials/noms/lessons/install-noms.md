## Goals (Learning Objectives)

After doing this tutorial you will know how to

* Install Noms on a unix-flavored OS
* Put Noms on your Command line

## Activities
These steps roughly follow the [Setup instructions on the Noms README](https://github.com/attic-labs/noms#setup)

### Step: Download the latest build

* Go to https://github.com/attic-labs/noms#setup
* Click the "download the latest Noms build" link
* Select the highest number listed,
* Download the .tar.gz file for your architecture (Mac OS X is "darwin")

### Make a noms directory
1. Create a directory within your homedir called "lib", and one inside that called "noms".  (You can do that with `mkdir -p ~/lib/noms` )
2. Move the downloaded .tar.gz file into that directory
3. Extract the .tar.gz file as directed: `tar -xzf noms-*.tar.gz`
4. Make a "bin" directory in your homedir: `mkdir -p ~/bin`
5. Move into your new bin directory ( `cd ~/bin` )

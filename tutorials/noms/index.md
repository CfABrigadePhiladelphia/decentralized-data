title: Intro to Noms
---

This workshop is an introduction to [Noms](https://github.com/attic-labs/noms), which is "a new database that makes it easy to store, move, and collaborate on large-scale structured data". You can think of Noms as a "git for data" because it allows you to track datasets in the way that git tracks text files.  Noms is more than a "git for data" though. It's a full-fledged database that is

* Content-addressed
* Append-only
* Decentralized
... and Typed.

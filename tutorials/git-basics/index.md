## Overview

This tutorial introduces Github Workflow and using Git locally on the command line.

## Prerequisites

* Install git on your machine
* Create a [github](https://github.com) account

## Learning Objectives

After this tutorial you will know how to

* Create a Github repository
* Use Github's web UI to create files and modify them
* Use Github's web UI to create git branches, submit Pull Requests and merge Pull Requests
* Use the git command line to add files, make commits, create branches, and push/pull repositories
* Explain how a git-based workflow allows people to work on code in parallel
* Explain what the `git status` command shows you
* Explain what the `git branch` command shows you
* Explain the notion of a _working copy_ in a git repository

## Key Concepts

* Git commits and branches
* Pull Requests
* Github Workflow

## Conceptual Framework

These two lessons will walk you through using git and Github to track files as they change over time. If you understand _why_ we use git to track files and understand a couple key concepts such as Commits, Branches, and Pull Requests.

_Jadrian and Matt have come up with a little exercise to explain why we use git and how it allows people to work in parallel on the same software. In the future we might make a video of it and post the video here._

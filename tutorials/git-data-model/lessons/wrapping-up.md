## Goals (Learning Objectives)

This lesson is a review of all the concepts covered in the Git Internals tutorial.

## Activities

### Step 1: Test Your Understanding of Git Objects

 1. When you run `git checkout master`, which internal commands does that trigger?
 2. When you run `git add`, which internal commands does that trigger?
 3. Which git command triggers the `write-tree` internal command? What does that command do?

## Next Steps

If you want to learn more about git internals, proceed with the sections in the Git book on [Packfiles](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Packfiles), etc.

Otherwise, proceed to the [Introduction to IPFS](../../ipfs) tutorial.

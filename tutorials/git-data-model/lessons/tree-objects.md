## Goals (Learning Objectives)

After doing this tutorial you will know how to

* Add files to git's staging area using the `write-tree` command

## Activities

### Step 1: Git Internals - Tree Objects

Read the section under the heading 'Commit Objects' on the [Git Internals - git References](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Git-References#Tree-Objects) page. **Stop at the heading 'Commit Objects'.** We will cover that in the next lesson.

### Step 2: Test Your Understanding of Git Objects

 1. When you run `git add`, which internal commands does that trigger?
 2. Which git command triggers the `write-tree` internal command? What does that command do?

## Next Steps

Proceed to the [Commit Objects](../commit-objects) lesson.

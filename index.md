# Decentralized Data Workshops

These Workshops provide a practical introduction to distributed version control, distributed data systems, their use, and the underlying technologies that make them possible. Our goal is to provide a path for everyday developers to understand enough about distributed systems that they can write an [IPFS](http://ipfs.io) adapter for [noms](https://github.com/attic-labs/noms), as was suggested in [this issue](https://github.com/attic-labs/noms/issues/2123) in the noms issue tracker.

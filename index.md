# Decentralized Data Workshops

These Workshops provide a practical introduction to distributed version control, distributed data systems, their use, and the underlying technologies that make them possible. Our goal is to provide a path for everyday developers to understand enough about distributed systems that they can write an [IPFS](http://ipfs.io) adapter for [noms](https://github.com/attic-labs/noms), as was suggested in [this issue](https://github.com/attic-labs/noms/issues/2123) in the noms issue tracker.

## The Workshops

We will be conducting 10 Weeks of workshops:

1. Introduction: Project overview, roadmap, and technical fundamentals
2. [Get Started with Golang](tutorials/get-started-with-golang)
3. Version Control Week I: Git hands-on & light theory
4. Version Control Week II: Noms hands-on
5. Version Control Week III: Panel discussion — what do our users want to do with their data?  How could Noms (and Noms+IPFS) help?
6. Version Control Week IV: deeper theory / data model
7. IPFS: hands-on & theory

The IPFS workshop would be the final “pre-development” workshop.  We’ve planned for 8 weeks for these workshops (10/4–11/22) to allow a little flex.  The following workshops will be our “transition to development” phase, during which participants will need to decide whether they’ll participate in the sprints going forward.

8. Testing / TDD: as a group, brainstorm test cases for the Noms connector
9. Development Process / Methodology

After this, we'll do eight weeks of development sprints, during which we'll design, build, test, and deploy our Noms–IPFS connector.
